Create an express back-end application for a Blog website using MongoDB. You should
refer to your database model from Module 8 for this, ensuring that your app matches the

● The system should be able to create users.
● The users should be able to create multiple posts (posts should be very basic with
title, description and image)

### Exercise
Choose a third-party microservice (see the list of free JSON APIs) and connect it to your
current express application (or a new one) with its own routes, controller and model, to
add new functionality to your application.

###
Try to include support for either or both types of request parameters:
● via the query - eg. GET http://localhost:8080/api/users?page=1
● via the params - eg. PUT http://localhost:8080/api/users/1234

## Module9Lab5
Using the guide at https://socket.io/get-started/chat as a helper, try to implement a basic
chat app which includes one of their suggested extensions (or come up with your own!):
● Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
● Add support for nicknames.
● Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead, append the message
directly as soon as he/she presses enter.
● Add “{user} is typing” functionality.
● Show who’s online.
